// Open the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.
// Change the useState to be initialised to an empty array ([])
// There will now be a bug in your app! We don't see how many Pokemon we have caught. Discuss with another trainee what you think the problem is.
// Change the JSX to instead render caught.length. Does this fix the bug?
// Let's now show the names of the Pokemon we have caught. Render a <ul> element within the component. Then use the map method to loop through each item in the caught array and render it in an <li> element.
// Change the catchPokemon function to add a new Pokemon (it doesn't matter which one) onto the caught array. (Hint: use the concat method.)
